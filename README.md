# Bandpass-Filter
## A simple bandpass filter designed in Simulink

Bandpass Filter
A bandpass filter (BPF) is an electronic circuit or system that allows frequencies within a certain range (passband) to pass while attenuating frequencies outside this range (stopband). It is widely used in communication systems, audio processing, and signal analysis.

Types of Bandpass Filters:
Active Bandpass Filter – Uses operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors.
Passive Bandpass Filter – Uses only resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

Now, max voltage is obtained at 10V, using Resonant Frequency formula, where Resonant Frequency = 4467 Hz
